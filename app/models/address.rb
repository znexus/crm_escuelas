# Represents a generic mailing address. Addresses are expected to consist of the
# following fields:
# * +addressable+ - The record that owns the address
# * +street_1+ - The first line of the street address
# * +city+ - The name of the city
# * +postal_code+ - A value uniquely identifying the area in the city
# * +region+ - Either a known region or a custom value for countries that have no list of regions available
# * +country+ - The country, which may be implied by the region
# 
# The following fields are optional:
# * +street_2+ - The second lien of the street address
# 
# There is no attempt to validate the open-ended fields since the context in
# which the addresses will be used is unknown
